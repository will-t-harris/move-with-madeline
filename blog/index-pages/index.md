title: Hi, I'm Madeline!
intro: Movement to me doesn't just refer to physical activity. It's a mindset
  that involves nutrition, travel, fitness, and the eagerness to just keep
  moving! I live in Southern California with my husband, Brad, and our dog,
  Riley. I'm looking forward to sharing my life with you, and maybe inspire you
  to also keep moving!
