This is my go to breakfast recipe when I’m at home. It’s packed with protein, full of veggies, and can be made completely vegan and/or pescatarian (my version includes salmon). We typically only shop at Trader Joe’s, so all of the ingredients are based off of their items.

**Ingredients:**

* Organic sprouted tofu (make sure you choose the firmest type available)
* 5-6 carrots
* Bag of shaved brussels sprouts
* 1/4 diced white onion
* Handful of chopped kale
* Avocado oil (this is my favorite oil, but any type will do)
* Pastrami style smoked salmon (optional)
* Garlic powder (optional)
* Nutritional yeast (optional)
* Black pepper (optional)

**Step 1**

Heat medium sized skillet with 2-3 tbsp. avocado oil

**Step 2**

Dice onion, and chop carrots into small slivers. Add both to the skillet

**Step 3**

Sauté the carrots and onion on medium heat until the onions become translucent. Then add the brussels sprouts, kale, and about 1/4 cup of water. Cover and let steam for 5-7 minutes

**Step 4**

Crumble both blocks of tofu into the pan. I find the best consistency is when I squeeze small portions by hand. You can chop the blocks if you want, I just prefer the texture of scrambled eggs

**Step 5**

**\*Skip if you want to keep this vegan\***

Add the smoked salmon with the tofu, and continue cooking for 3-4 minutes

**Step 6**

Mix in whatever seasoning you want! I use garlic powder, nutritional yeast, and pepper. THAT’S IT! Feel free to customize the flavor as much as you want. I typically add some hot sauce on top, and start digging in!
