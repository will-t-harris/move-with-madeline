If you’re new to the meat substitute game, this is an ingredient that you’ll want to get to know ASAP. Also known as the durian fruit, the internet refers to it as the “smelliest fruit in the world”. But don’t let that turn you away! It is such an easy replacement for meat, and is very versatile in the kitchen.

I personally haven’t been able to find the fruit in its whole form yet, but Trader Joe’s carries cans of jackfruit in brine (for only $1.99). This recipe calls for 2 cans, but it’s still way cheaper than having to buy a few pounds of meat (and also better for the environment!)

You can think of the texture as being shredded “meat”, which means it’s an easy swap for a lot of recipes. I’ve added it to a chicken-less noodle soup before, and also tossed it into the slow cooker with bbq sauce. Both had very tasty results!

Let’s get started!

Ingredient list:

* 2 cans of jackfruit
* 1/2 white onion
* 2 tbsp minced garlic
* 2-3 tbsp avocado oil (any type of oil works)
* 1 packet taco seasoning
* Any toppings you prefer

Step 1

Heat the oil in a medium sizes saucepan

Step 2

Once heated, add the garlic and diced onion. Sauté until onions become translucent

Step 3

Shred the jackfruit (I typically just pull each part apart by hand), then add to the pan

Step 4

After sautéing for a few minutes, add the taco seasoning, and if needed 1/4 cup water. You want the seasoning to be absorbed by the fruit, but not have too much liquid

Step 5

Toss the filling into a tortilla, or on top of a salad, or just eat as is! I like to add hot sauce, tomatoes, and avocado. Feel free to customize as much as you’d like
