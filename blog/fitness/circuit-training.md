MY FAVORITE TYPE OF TRAINING!



If you’ve been frequenting the gym for a while, you’ve probably seen or heard of circuit training already. If you haven’t, then here’s some quick details:



* The basic idea is to perform several different exercises back to back, with minimal rest between each move
* Circuits can range in intensity from light to heavy
* There is typically some kind of time interval involved, either between movements or between rounds
* It is a VERY effective way to improve cardiovascular health, burn calories, and also keep yourself entertained in the gym
* **THE BEST PART**, most circuits can be completed with zero gym equipment. Think bodyweight movements such as burpees, pushups, crunches, lunges, etc.

I personally enjoy circuit training 3-4 times per week, along with some weight lifting and yoga mixed in here and there. There are also different forms of circuit training, here are a few terms that you might come across:



* HIIT- high intensity interval training

*ex: sprint for 30 seconds, then rest for 30 seconds*

* MIIT & LIIT- medium and light intensity interval training

*ex: jog for 45 seconds, rest for 15 seconds. You could even apply this to a walking workout*

* EMOM- every minute on the minute

*ex: set a timer for 1 minute. Perform 10-15 reps of an exercise, then rest for the remaining seconds of that minute before moving on to the next movement*

* AMRAP- as many rounds as possible

*ex: Set your time for 20-30 minutes. Perform 4-6 different exercises continuously for the entire 20-30 minutes. Rest only when needed*

There are a ton of free resources available online for you to create your own circuit workout (you can find quite a few on [my IG page](https://www.instagram.com/move.with.madeline/)). I encourage you to try one out, make it your own, and stay creative! Changing up the rest periods, or even adding weights to some movements will keep your mind and body fresh!
