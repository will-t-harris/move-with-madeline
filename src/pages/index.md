title: Hi friend, I'm Madeline Paige
intro: "Movement to me isn't just a term for physical activity. It's a lifestyle
  that involves nutrition, travel, fitness, and the willingness to just keep
  moving! I live in Southern California with my husband, Brad, and our dog,
  Riley. I'm looking forward to sharing my life with you, and hopefully
  inspiring you to join my movement! "
